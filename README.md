# txtUDL
A bit of a personal front-end/ui project for myself. I take a lot of notes in simple text files and use notepad++ a lot.
So this is a Notepad++ User Defined Language for .txt files to make it automatically do some formatting without the need of a markup language extension.
Designed to make it easier to read and write my personal notes.

Right now there's a little bit of a wonkiness with //ing, I wanted // to be a comment because that's what I do with my notetaking sometimes, but it shouldn't make every link blue. I don't mind it though.
numbering systems, bullet points, headers.

I use this nordtheme for my base colors for notepad++ and have built the colors around that.
The more important part of the UDL is having a reasonable basis for all the rules in place so that customizing the colors is easy. 

Will make improvements as I see them.
